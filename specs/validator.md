## Introduction

This document explains the way in which a beacon chain validator is expected to use the [Builder spec][builder-spec] to
participate in an external builder network.

At a high-level, there is a registration step validators must perform ahead of any proposal duties so builders know how
to craft blocks for their specific proposal. Having performed the registration, a validator waits until it is their turn
to propose the next block in the chain. The validator then requests an `ExecutionPayload` from the external builder
network to put into their `SignedBeaconBlock` in lieu of one they could build locally.

## Prerequisites

This document assumes knowledge of the terminology, definitions, and other material in the [Builder spec][builder-spec]
and by extension the [Bellatrix consensus specs][bellatrix-specs].

## Constants

| Name | Value | Units |
| - | - | - |
| `EPOCHS_PER_VALIDATOR_REGISTRATION_SUBMISSION` | 1 | epoch(s)|
| `BUILDER_PROPOSAL_DELAY_TOLERANCE` | 1 | second(s) |

## Validator registration

A validator begins interacting with the external builder network by submitting a signed registration to each of the
builders it wants to utilize during block production.

### Preparing a registration

To do this, the validator client assembles a [`ValidatorRegistrationV1`][validator-registration-v1] with the following
information:

* `fee_recipient`: an execution layer address where fees for the validator should go.
* `gas_limit`: the value a validator prefers for the execution block gas limit.
* `timestamp`: a recent timestamp later than any previously constructed `ValidatorRegistrationV1`.
  Builders use this timestamp as a form of anti-DoS and to sequence registrations.
* `pubkey`: the validator's public key. Used to identify the beacon chain validator and verify the wrapping signature.

### Signing and submitting a registration

The validator takes the constructed `ValidatorRegistrationV1` `message` and signs according to the method given in
the [Builder spec][builder-spec] to make a `signature`.

This `signature` is placed along with the `message` into a `SignedValidatorRegistrationV1` and submitted to a connected
beacon node using the [`registerValidator`][register-validator-api] endpoint of the standard validator
[beacon node APIs][beacon-node-apis].

Validators **should** submit valid registrations well ahead of any potential beacon chain proposal duties to ensure
their building preferences are widely available in the external builder network.

### Registration dissemination

Validators are expected to periodically send their own `SignedValidatorRegistrationV1` messages upstream to the external
builder network using the [`registerValidator`][register-validator-with-builder] endpoint of the standard
[APIs defined in the builder spec][builder-spec-apis].

Registrations should be re-submitted frequently enough that any changes to their building preferences can be widely
spread across the builder network in a timely manner.

This specification suggests validators re-submit to builder software every
`EPOCHS_PER_VALIDATOR_REGISTRATION_SUBMISSION` epochs.

## Beacon chain responsibilities

Refer to the [Bellatrix validator specs][bellatrix-validator-specs] for the expected set of duties a validator is
expected to perform, including a pathway for local block building. The external builder network offers a separate block
building pathway that can be used concurrently with this local process.

### Block proposal

#### Constructing the `BeaconBlockBody`

##### ExecutionPayload

To obtain an execution payload, a block proposer building a block on top of a beacon `state` in a given `slot` must take
the following actions:

1. Call upstream builder software to get an `ExecutionPayloadHeader` with the
   required data `slot`, `parent_hash` and `pubkey`, where:
   * `slot` is the proposal's slot
   * `parent_hash` is the value `state.latest_execution_payload_header.block_hash`
   * `pubkey` is the propser's public key
2. Assemble a `BlindedBeaconBlock` according to the process outlined in the [Bellatrix specs][bellatrix-specs] but with
   the `ExecutionPayloadHeader` from the prior step in lieu of the full `ExecutionPayload`.
3. The proposer signs the `BlindedBeaconBlock` and assembles a `SignedBlindedBeaconBlock` which is returned to the
   upstream builder software.
4. The upstream builder software responds with the full `ExecutionPayload`. The proposer can use this payload
   to assemble a `SignedBeaconBlock` following the rest of the proposal process outlined in the
   [Bellatrix specs][bellatrix-specs].

#### Relation to local block building

The external builder network offers a service for proposers that may from time to time fail to produce a timely block.
Honest proposers who elect to use the external builder network **MUST** also build a block locally in the event that the
external builder network fails to provide a `SignedBuilderBid` in time in order to propagate the full
`SignedBeaconBlock` during the proposer's slot.

Honest proposers using the external builder network will give the builders a duration of
`BUILDER_PROPOSAL_DELAY_TOLERANCE` to provide a `SignedBuilderBid` before the external builder is considered to have hit
the deadline and the external builder flow must be aborted in favor of a local build process.

**WARNING**: Validators must be careful to not get slashed when orchestrating the duplicate building pathways.
  See the [section on slashing](#proposer-slashing) for more information.

## How to avoid slashing

### Proposer slashing

Validators must take care to not publish signatures for two distinct blocks even if there is a failure with the external
builder network. A `ProposerSlashing` can be formed in this event from the competing beacon block headers which results
in getting slashed.

To avoid slashing when using the external builder network, a validator should begin the external build process for an
`ExecutionPayloadHeader` along with the local build process for an `ExecutionPayload` as soon as they know the required
parameters to do so. Regardless of which process completes in time, the validator should cancel the other
process as soon as they have produced a signature for a beacon block, either a `BeaconBlock` **or** a
`BlindedBeaconBlock`. Producing distinct signatures for the validator's proposal slot, for example because the
transactions list of the `BeaconBlockBody` are different, is the slashable offense. This means if a validator publishes
a signature for a `BlindedBeaconBlock` (via a dissemination of a `SignedBlindedBeaconBlock`) then the validator
**MUST** not use the local build process as a fallback, even in the event of some failure with the external builder
network.

## Responsibilites during the Merge transition

Honest validators will not utilize the external builder network until after the transition from the proof-of-work chain
to the proof-of-stake beacon chain has been finalized by the proof-of-stake validators. This requirement is in place
to reduce the overall technical complexity of the Merge. Concretely this means a honest validator client will not use
any of the builder APIs or run any builder software until the Merge has finalized.

## Proposer config file

Proposer config file could be used by a `validator` client on the Consensus Layer when more fine-grained proposer configuration is required. The same config file could also be used by `mev-boost` implementations.

### File format

A consistent proposer config file format across `validator` and `mev-boost` components will allow for easier setup and maintenance when running `builder` architectures. JSON is the recommended data format.

#### Specification

Below is a list of the fields which should be part of the proposer config. Some are mandatory, while others are optional.

##### `builder_relays_groups`
`optional`
A map of relay endpoints by id, which could later be used to reference a group of relays. It helps with repetition when multiple validators need to be configured with the same set of relays.

##### `proposer_config`
`optional`
A map where the key is the public key of the validator and the value is the proposer configuration for the specific validator.

* **`fee_recipient`** : `string [optional]` Ethereum address which the execution layer will use as a recipient of fees and MEV rewards for the specific validator.
* **`builder`** : `[optional]` builder configuration for the specific validator
    * **`enabled`** : `boolean [mandatory]` Enable or disable the builder interface. For `validator` clients, this will mean, no builder validator registrations will be sent to the Beacon Node.
    * **`gas_limit`** : `string [optional]` an uint64 as a string in decimal number format. If no gas_limit is defined, the gas_limit from the [default_config](##default_config) would be used.
    * **`relays`** : `array [optional]` specific relays to use for the specific validator. It can also reference the group ids from [builder_relays_groups](##builder_relays_groups). This field will be used by `mev-boost` component to direct validators to certain relays.

##### `default_config`
`mandatory`
In case no specific configuration is setup for a validator in the [proposer_config](##proposer_config), this default configuration will be used.

* **`fee_recipient`** : `string [mandatory]` Ethereum address which the execution layer will use as a recipient of fees and MEV rewards
* **`builder`** : `[optional]` Default builder configuration. It follows the same structure as the [proposer_config](##proposer_config)
